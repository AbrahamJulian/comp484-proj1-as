                    <h3>Family</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your "Family" is your group of characters. They're all considered members of whatever family name you choose at the very start, 
                        and the family name shows above each character along with their character name. Letters, numbers, and optionally an underscore 
                        in the middle. You can change it later with a cash shop purchase.</p>

                    <h3>NPC Interaction</h3>
                    <p>
                        In BDO, Knowledge is a measure of how much questing, hunting, and overall game experience your characters have. 
                        The most important reason to acquire Knowledge, is because it rewards your Family account with Energy. 
                        Energy is like a type of currency in the game. With a little Energy, you can do fun and profitable things in Black Desert Online, 
                        like wood chopping, mining, picking flowers, and gathering other goodies. But thatâ€™s just the beginning of what Energy can do.

                    <h3>Marketplace</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Marketplace is the only place in Black Desert Online where you can sell items to or buy items from other players. 
                        You can directly buy all listed items in the marketplace, or put a pre-order on that items. If you were to put a pre-order, 
                        when a player list the item, it would automatically be sold to you. 
                        As a reminder, all transaction in marketplace have 30% tax.
                        You can access the Marketplace via the Marketplace Directors in large towns.

                    <h3>Progression System</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Black Desert Online, the power level system is calculated based on 2 things, Attack Points (AP) and Defense Points (DP).
                        These 2 points can be obtained by enhancing gear or getting a boss-rate gear. The higher your gear level,
                        then the higher your AP and DP will be.
                        <br>
                        There are three grade level for the gear, sorted from lowest to highest: white, green, blue, yellow. Upon obtaining one of these gear
                        you can enhance it from +0 to +15. Once you hit +15 you can enhance it using higher-grade upgrade material
                        from pri to pen.
                        <br>
                        The endgame of this game is to hit pen on all gear.
