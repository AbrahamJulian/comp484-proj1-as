                    <p><b>Black Desert Online</b> is a sandbox, living-world MMORPG game. It features fast-paced,  action-packed combat, hunt monsters
                    and huge bosses, the kind that you see in Monster Hunter. You can also fight with friends in a guild
                    to siege nodes and conquer territory. Aside from the combat, the game also have life-skilling content, such
                    fishing, trading, crafting, cooking, and much more!
                    <br>
                    Below are few basics that can help you understand the game better.

                    <h3>Family</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your "Family" is your group of characters. They're all considered members of whatever family name you choose at the very start, 
                        and the family name shows above each character along with their character name. Letters, numbers, and optionally an underscore 
                        in the middle. You can change it later with a cash shop purchase.</p>

                    <h3>NPC Interaction</h3>
                    <p>
                        In BDO, Knowledge is a measure of how much questing, hunting, and overall game experience your characters have. 
                        The most important reason to acquire Knowledge, is because it rewards your Family account with Energy. 
                        Energy is like a type of currency in the game. With a little Energy, you can do fun and profitable things in Black Desert Online, 
                        like wood chopping, mining, picking flowers, and gathering other goodies. But thatâ€™s just the beginning of what Energy can do.

                    <h3>Marketplace</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Marketplace is the only place in Black Desert Online where you can sell items to or buy items from other players. 
                        You can directly buy all listed items in the marketplace, or put a pre-order on that items. If you were to put a pre-order, 
                        when a player list the item, it would automatically be sold to you. 
                        As a reminder, all transaction in marketplace have 30% tax.
                        You can access the Marketplace via the Marketplace Directors in large towns.

                    <h3>Nodes and Contribution</h3>
                    <p>
                        These are a brand new concept for most of us. It's easy to completely ignore them for a long time, but experienced players are in agreement that it's 
                        something that you want to pick up very early on, even if you don't make use of all of the features on Day One.<br>
                        <br>
                        Every area of the game is part of one node. The mini-map tells you which node applies to the spot you're standing in. 
                        Aside from cities, nodes are indicated on the main game map with an icon of two arrows going up and curving out to either side. 
                        Each node has a Node Manager (usually an NPC, sometimes a landmark) that you seek out and interact with in order to open that node for 
                        activation, and to start displaying it on the map. You've gotta click the Node Management button while interacting with them to open it up.

                    <h3>Workers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Much like the node system, it's easy to ignore the worker system until much later in the game, 
                        but experienced players strongly recommend you figure it out enough to at least get one or two workers 
                        harvesting for you around the starter cities so you've got some foundation of understanding to build from when you start your economic 
                        empire of practically free income.

                    <h3>Progression System</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Black Desert Online, the power level system is calculated based on 2 things, Attack Points (AP) and Defense Points (DP).
                        These 2 points can be obtained by enhancing gear or getting a boss-rate gear. The higher your gear level,
                        then the higher your AP and DP will be.
                        <br>
                        There are three grade level for the gear, sorted from lowest to highest: white, green, blue, yellow. Upon obtaining one of these gear
                        you can enhance it from +0 to +15. Once you hit +15 you can enhance it using higher-grade upgrade material
                        from pri to pen.
                        <br>
                        The endgame of this game is to hit pen on all gear.
